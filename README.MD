# Temperatures and spreadsheet workflow

This is a project that involves temperature calculations and spreadsheet
column extraction, Â¡This was made for fun!

To setup your amazing library you just have to clone this repo and add
whatever you want, call out the functions or add new ones created
by you.

Here's an example of a code line calling one of the amazing functions
developed by the great community of one student in a course:

```
import pandas as pd

tempDataset = pd.read_csv("airTemps.csv")

meanAirTemp = mean_temperature(meanAirTemp)

print(meanAirTemp)
```

The above should return the mean air temperature out of a csv previously
loaded to the workspace.
